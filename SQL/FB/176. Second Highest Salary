Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+


// 这种写法是标准的，但是有错误。就是当不存在第二的时候，会返回[], 而题目要求返回[null]
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

// 改正后的写法，两种都可以
SELECT 
( SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) 
AS SecondHighestSalary;

SELECT 
( SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) 
AS SecondHighestSalary;


SELECT 
    IFNULL ( 
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
         FROM Employee 
         ORDER BY Salary DESC
         LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), 
    NULL)
AS SecondHighestSalary;
