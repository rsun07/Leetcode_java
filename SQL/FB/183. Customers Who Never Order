Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+


SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers where Customers.id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId from Orders);

SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers c where c.id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId from Orders);


注意两个点，等于是一个等于号不是两个。是null 不用等于号，要用IS

SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON c.Id = o.CustomerId
WHERE o.CustomerId IS NULL;
